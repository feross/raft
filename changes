# Changes

- Renamed peer.proto to peer-message.proto and storage.proto to
  storage-message.proto to match the names of the message "classes", PeerMessage
  and StorageMessage.

- Refactored the logger class to use C style logging (i.e. a mutex and printf)
  instead of the more complicated C++ style stream logging.

- Removed the ostreamlock abstraction entirely since we use a mutex to lock
  stdout and stderr now.

- Keep track of votes in a set instead of a map.

- Moved portions of our verbose constructor comments to the top of files.

- Refactored Timer class to have more timer precision. Instead of waking up at
  regular 100ms intervals, we use a condition variable to sleep for the exact
  correct amount of time.

- Changed server ids to be integer type instead of string type.

- Added support for a config file format which makes starting the server require
  many fewer command line arguments. The same config file can be used by all the
  servers in the Raft cluster.

- Significantly refactored Peer to include streamparser logic inside.  This allowed
  us to avoid using tuple, avoid allocating some large extra heap buffers, avoid
  split responsibilities for managing memory, etc.

- Also updated Peer to use more explicit threads (rather than "register listener"
  functions) and updated to log a bit more verbose and avoid some opaque code.
