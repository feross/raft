# Changes

- Renamed peer.proto to peer-message.proto and storage.proto to
  storage-message.proto to match the names of the message "classes", PeerMessage
  and StorageMessage.
- Refactored the logger class to use C style logging (i.e. a mutex and printf)
  instead of the more complicated C++ style stream logging.
- Removed the ostreamlock abstraction entirely since we use a mutex to lock
  stdout and stderr now.
